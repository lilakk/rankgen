Activation of the ketone by the acid catalyst generates a pentadienyl cation, which undergoes a thermally allowed 4\u03c0 conrotatory electrocyclization as dictated by the Woodward-Hoffman rules. This generates an oxyallyl cation which undergoes an elimination reaction to lose a \u03b2-hydrogen. Subsequent tautomerization of the enolate produces the cyclopentenone product. As noted above, variants that deviate from this template are known; what designates a Nazarov cyclization in particular is the generation of the pentadienyl cation followed by electrocyclic ring closure to an oxyallyl cation. In order to achieve this transformation, the molecule must be in the s-trans/s-trans conformation, placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation.", "targets": ["The propensity of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate, with \u03b1-substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite conformer due to allylic strain.
